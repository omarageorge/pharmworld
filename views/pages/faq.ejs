          <h2>How do I purchase a product?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              When you place an order with Pharmworld, our Pharmacy technician
              will receive it, generate an invoice with a bitcoin payment link,
              and send it to the email address you provided when you signed up.
            </li>

            <li>
              When you click on the invoice link, you will be taken to a page
              with a QR code that you can scan with your bitcoin wallet to pay
              for the orders you placed.
            </li>

            <li>
              When the payment is complete, we will be notified. Following that,
              we will deliver your order to the address you provided.
            </li>

            <li>
              <mark> We only accept bitcoin as payment. </mark>

        <div class="question">
          <h2>How long does it take for my order to ship and arrive?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Orders will be shipped the following business day after payment is
              received. Orders can also be shipped within 2-3 hours of receiving
              payment, depending on when payment is received.
            </li>

            <li>
              Shipping should take 2-3 days depending on where in the US you are
              located
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="question">
          <h2>What if my order does not arrive on time?</h2>
          <p>
            Our orders are always delivered on time. We will track your order
            and provide updates as needed. If an order does not arrive at its
            destination, we will send another order only if the tracking
            indicates that it has not been delivered. If the tracking number
            indicates that the order has been delivered, we are not responsible
            for it.

        <div class="question">
          <h2>Are products listed fake or pressed?</h2>
          <p>
            <mark className="bg-yellow-200">
              ALL PRODUCTS ARE 100% LEGIT & AUTHENTIC . NO PRODUCTS ARE PRESSED
              OR CONTAIN ANY INGREDIENTS OTHER THEN WHAT IS LISTED IN THE
              DESCRIPTIONS . PHARMWORLD CLIENTS HEALTH IS OUR NUMBER 1 PRIORITY
              NOT MONEY!!!!!. ALL MEDICINES COME FROM LEGIT PHARMACYS AND
              MANUFACTURERS. ALL PRODUCTS WILL BE LIMITED AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE
              ONLY SELL LEGIT AUTHENTIC PRODUCTS. WHEN PRODUCTS ARE PRESSED OR
              FAKE THE SELLER WILL USUALLY HAVE UNLIMITED AMOUNTS AVAILABLE
              WHICH IS THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE OF PHARMWORLD. WE ARE FIRST COME
              FIRST SERVE. AFTER PRODUCTS ARE SOLD OUT CUSTOMERS MUST WAIT UNTIL
              THE NEXT MONTH WHEN WE RECEIVE OUR NEW LEGIT SCRIPTS. WE ARE HERE

        <div class="question">
          <h2>Do I pay for shipping ?</h2>
          <p>
            Shipping is completely free. It's our way of showing customers how
            much we appreciate their business.

        <div class="question">
          <h2>
            If I order a certain quantity will I get a discount or wholesale
            price?
          </h2>
          <p>
            The prices remain the same regardless of the quantity ordered. We
            are not wholesalers. We do occasionally offer special discounts to
            returning customers.
