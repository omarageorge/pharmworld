              Once the payment is received, click the "Confirm Payment" option so that your order is listed as paid and we can examine it. We will know whether you click that button before your cash are sent.

        <div class="question">
          <h2>How long does it take for my order to ship and arrive?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Orders will be shipped the following business day after payment is
              received. Orders can also be shipped within 2-3 hours of receiving
              payment, depending on when payment is received.

        <div class="question">
          <h2>What if my order does not arrive on time?</h2>
          <p>
            Our orders are always delivered on time. We will track your order
            and provide updates as needed. If an order does not arrive at its
            destination, we will send another order only if the tracking
            indicates that it has not been delivered. If the tracking number
            indicates that the order has been delivered, we are not responsible
            for it.

        <div class="question">
          <h2>Do I pay for shipping ?</h2>
          <p>
            Shipping is completely free. It's our way of showing customers how
            much we appreciate their business.

        <div class="question">
          <h2>
            If I order a certain quantity will I get a discount or wholesale
            price?

          <p>
            The prices remain the same regardless of the quantity ordered. We
            are not wholesalers. We do occasionally offer special discounts to
            returning customers.
